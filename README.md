# Introduction

Since the beginning of complex Linux server architectures, the way of configuring servers was either by using the command line, or by using bash scripts. Bash scripts are awesome but using them for configuring several servers is not a good idea. The script might run successfully, simply break, or things could completely go out of control. No one can tell. 

This is where the different configuration management solutions came up to reduce such problems. First, Puppet was born, then came Chef and finally Ansible was introduced .In this book we talk about Ansible on linux, If you haven't get familiar with Ansible yet, take this book as quick  guide and if you already know about Ansible, read it to review what you know.
